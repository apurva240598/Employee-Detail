React.js!
Welcome!

Before you start
In order to properly work through this module smoothly we're going to use software that will allow us to write React applications with ease. It's called create-react-app.

Go to your command line and execute the following:

npm install -g create-react-app
Now verify that you have it by executing the following:

create-react-app --version
It should be at least version 2.1.x.

How to run this Code?
You can copy all these files to your react-app folder/src.
Install Axios using npm install axios
You can run the code using npm start
