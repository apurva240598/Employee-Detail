# Employee-Detail
React.js!
Welcome!

Before you start
In order to properly work through this module smoothly we're going to use software that will allow us to write React applications with ease. It's called create-react-app.

Go to your command line and execute the following:

npm install -g create-react-app
Now verify that you have it by executing the following:

create-react-app --version
It should be at least version 2.1.x.
